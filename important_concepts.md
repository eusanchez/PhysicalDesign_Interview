1. DVFS
**DVFS** is Dynamic Volatage and Frequency Scaling. Is a power management technique where the system dynamically adjusts the voltage and clock frequency of a processor based on workload demand. 

2.Frequency
Does not determine whether the circuit is faster or slower, rather it determines how many operations per second. Performance depends on *frequency* + architecture + IPC

3. Period
Formula -> Period = 1/frequency
